## Dotfiles

There are my dotfiles for my personal computer. They are managed using [Nix](https://nixos.org/) and [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).

A shout-out to [@nmasur](https://github.com/nmasur) and his [dotfiles](https://github.com/nmasur/dotfiles). His work with multiple hosts is awesome and is helping me with my own dotfiles.
